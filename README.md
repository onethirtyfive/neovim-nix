# Personal Neovim Flake

[![Build All Outputs](https://github.com/onethirtyfive/neovim-nix/actions/workflows/build-all-outputs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/onethirtyfive/neovim-nix/actions/workflows/build-all-outputs.yml)

## Purpose

There are a litany of neovim flakes on github. Most of them expose options to
change how the package builds. This is my personal neovim configuration--it is
not configurable because it is bespoke. It is exactly what I need and no more.

Shared in case folks need a basis for making their own neovim.

Thanks to PrimaMateria's excellent [blog
post](https://primamateria.github.io/blog/neovim-nix/) on how to do this.
